## Tech Time - TalentPlus frontend developer evaluation
The goal of this project is to evaluate a frontend developer's abilities. There are three sections to this assessment.

• Develop the design that was sent in the initial assessment invite mail.
• Dockerize the app by creating a docker file and explain in a README file how to build and run the app in docker.
• Record a video not more than 8 mins long showcasing the landing page and the docker setup.

## Design
https://www.figma.com/file/efaADvQRuRa9E7GOp8MvP3/Techtime?node-id=1476-4&t=73OxeijDnXZIVDTu-0

## Tech Stack
• NextJS
• Styled-Components
• Typescript

## Run Locally
Firstly, clone the repo on your local machine by running
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Temitayo-spec/TechTime.git
```
Go to the project directory
```bash
  cd name-of-project
```
Then install the dependencies by running
```bash
    npm install or yarn install
```
To spin up the development server, you need to run
```bash
    npm run dev or yarn dev
```
Congratulations! If you followed these steps, then you can go to your browser and load the app on localhost:3000 in your browser.

## Inability to Support Docker and Dockerizing the App

This section of the README explains that the current PC configuration does not support Docker and therefore, it is not possible to Dockerize the application.

## System Requirements:

Docker requires a minimum of 4GB RAM and 64-bit Windows 10 Pro, Enterprise or Education editions (excluding Windows 10 Home). It also requires a compatible CPU architecture, virtualization support, and a minimum of 20GB of free disk space.

Unfortunately, the current PC does not meet the above requirements and therefore, cannot support Docker. As a result, Dockerizing the application is not possible.

## Alternative Solutions:

However, there are alternative solutions to run the application on this PC. You can run the application locally by installing the required software components on the PC. Alternatively, you can deploy the application to a virtual machine or cloud-based service that supports Docker.

## Conclusion:

I understand that Docker is a popular tool for developers, but unfortunately, this PC configuration does not meet the minimum requirements to support Docker. I recommend exploring alternative solutions to run the application locally or in a virtual environment. Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or concerns.


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
