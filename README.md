## Tech Time - TalentPlus frontend developer evaluation
The goal of this project is to evaluate a frontend developer's abilities. There are three sections to this assessment.

• Develop the design that was sent in the initial assessment invite mail.
• Dockerize the app by creating a docker file and explain in a README file how to build and run the app in docker.
• Record a video not more than 8 mins long showcasing the landing page and the docker setup.

## Design

## Tech Stack
• NextJS
• Styled-Components
• Typescript

## Run Locally
Firstly, clone the repo on your local machine by running
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Temitayo-spec/TechTime.git
```
Go to the project directory
```bash
  cd name-of-project
```
Then install the dependencies by running
```bash
    npm install or yarn install
```
To spin up the development server, you need to run
```bash
    npm run dev or yarn dev
```
Congratulations! If you followed these steps, then you can go to your browser and load the app on localhost:3000 in your browser.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
